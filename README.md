## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.


## Setting Up Flutter

Flutter can be a little odd to set up. IF you do not already have Android Studio and flutter + dart fully functoinal I would recommend you instead take a look at the [Youtube Video](#youtube-video) showcasing the app.

### Onto The Installation

To start you should head over to the [Flutter Doc Pages](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) to install the flutter SDK.

Make sure youre setting up for your operating system, and select the app type **Android**

Scroll down to the SDK section of the page. I would recommend using the "Install Using VSCode" option.

Continue following the guide and setup using Android Studio. We build our project using Android Studio so it should make things as simple as possible for you to run.

## Setting Up The Codebase

To start make sure you clone our repository to get all the content youll need to run the app locally.

```
git clone git@github.com:Hollowhking/HCIproject.git
```

Then open the project with android studio.

Once opened, you should just need to start your Android Virtual Device, click the run button, and youre set to use!
